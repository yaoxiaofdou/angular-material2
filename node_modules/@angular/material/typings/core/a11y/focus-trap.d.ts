 * Class that allows for trapping focus within a DOM element.

 * NOTE: This class currently uses a very simple (naive) approach to focus trapping.
 * It assumes that the tab order is the same as DOM order, which is not necessarily true.
 * Things like tabIndex > 0, flex `order`, and shadow roots can cause to two to misalign.
 * This will be replaced with a more intelligent solution before the library is considered stable.
